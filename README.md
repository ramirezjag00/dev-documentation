# Dev Onboarding Documentation?

> compilation of tech documentation ideas by n00n3xx
> 


> ðŸ’¡ Anything that could possibly get devs up to speed, tech set up, feel comfortable and confident, the faster they can produce quality code, learn more and contribute.
>
> Documentations can be as simple as README in a separate repository (ie. readme for each role) or using frameworks like docusaurus for APIs / libraries or using JSDoc/TSDoc/TypeDoc for codebase/block documentation or Storybook for components or using Notion for all documentations.
>
> The team can be as verbose or consise as they want. It doesn't matter to me ðŸ˜› as long as any dev level won't get lost while reading your ðŸ’©.
>
> There are a lot of open source projects that documents description & alternatives, how an individual can start contributing, see existing/closed issues, which features are merged and all change logs.
>
> Another example is the  [mattermost](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/) documentation, or in a form of [tech blog (by react native)](https://reactnative.dev/blog) or in a form of [working group](https://github.com/reactwg) (check any repo) or [discussions](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions) (for react-18)

>ðŸ’¡ for a long-term approach of a well-maintained codebase
>
> - [git tagging](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) to keep track of all codebase versions (releases, beta etc) + [changelog.md](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) to keep track of whatever a certain version has
>
> - using issues tab of git repos (with proper tagging and details) to keep track of any issues solved, existing ones, temporary/band-aid fixes, any documentation, maintainance, announcements etc.
